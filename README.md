## Overview

**Weather Now** is a web-based weather application that allows users to search and view current weather conditions for cities around the world. The app uses the [Weatherstack API](https://weatherstack.com/) to fetch real-time data and displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions. Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit and navigate between three fully functional pages: a home page, a details page, and a city comparison page with chart visualizations.

##  Target Browsers

This web application is made for modern browsers across desktop and mobile platforms:

- Chrome (Latest Desktop and Android)
-  Safari (iOS and Desktop)

The UI is responsive and designed using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure a smooth experience across screen sizes.
